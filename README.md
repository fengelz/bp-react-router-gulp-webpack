# Boilerplate: React-Router-Gulp-Webpack
Frontend Boilerplate with above tech

    run git clone
    run yarn
    run webpack-dev-server
    run gulp (in new tab)

webpack will handle the module bundling and webpack-dev-server will run the dev server with hot module reload

Gulp will take care of assets, html and sass and copy and concatinate all to a build folder
